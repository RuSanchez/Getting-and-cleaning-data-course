Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================


This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course.

There is just one script called run_analysis.R. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

        *Download UCI HAR zip file to temp dir
        *Read data
        *Do some transformations
        *Write output data to a txt file inside working directory
The CodeBook.md explains it more detailed.

Run from command line

Clone this repo
Run the script:

$ Rscript run_analysis.R

Look for the final dataset at Tidy data set.txt in the working directory
